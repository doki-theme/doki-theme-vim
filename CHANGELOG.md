# 78.0-1.0.6 [The Boys]

I'm trying to bring in a bit of inclusion.

**4 New Dark Themes!**

- I can already hear you now, "Rimiru Tempest, from 'That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime', is not a boy. They are the best genderless slime, get your facts correct." Yeah well....shut up.
- Next, is one of the S ranked heroes in the 'One Punch Man' universe, Genos.
- After that, is the smug smile of Yukihira Soma from Shokugeki no Soma. 
- Lastly, I am going to be honest, I haven't seen Haikyu. I just wanted a Indigo & Orange based theme. So here is Hinata Shoyo.

### Other Stuff

- Updated some of Rory, Ram, & Rem's syntax highlighting colors to be more usable.

# 74.1-1.0.0 [Synapse break. Vanishment, this world!]

**4 New Dark Themes!**

- Decimate errors in the code alongside the Wicked Lord Shingan. Let your inner fantasies go rampant with Rikka Takanashi from: "Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions". 
- It is comfy time! Don't let feature requests stress you out, because you can now code with Nadeshiko from Yuru Camp. 
- A Certain Scientific RailGun go: bzzzzzzt. Zap bugs out of existence with the electromaster Mikoto Misaka.
- Raccoon + Tanuki = one really cute cinnamon bun. Enjoy your time coding with Raphtalia from: "Rising of the Shield Hero."

# 14.0.0 [Holiday Release]

**3 New Dark Themes!**
 
- Celebrate Christmas with Chocola from the NekoPara Series!
_I lied about Shigure being the last addition from NekoPara._

- The 4th of July now just got even better, now that you can code with Essex from Azur Lane.
If you prefer a more canon experience, Essex's theme also has **secondary content** with the Eagle Union branding.

- Even though I missed this year's Halloween, I've got something to look forward to in 2022.
Yotsuba, from The Quintessential Quintuplets, isn't 2spooky4me.
